# FishFlocker
An implementation of the flocking algorithm in Unity.

**Important** The Colorful Sea-Fish pack is **not** included in this repository as it is not free.  If you'd like to use this, buy that pack or just replace the game objects with any you would like to use instead, even primative shapes work fine (although they will have no animation obviously).
